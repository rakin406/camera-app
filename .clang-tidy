WarningsAsErrors: '*,-clang-diagnostic-unused-function'
Checks: >
    Enable all warnings by default. This ensures we don't miss new and useful
    warnings when a new version of clang-tidy is dropped.

    IMPORTANT
    clang-tidy doesn't support comments but we can simulate comments by just
    writing text directly here. These are then interpreted as warnings and will
    be dropped. As long as you start every sentence with a capital letter and
    don't use commas in your "comments" you should be fine,
